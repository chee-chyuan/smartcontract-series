# Trying out typescript

- Trying to set up hardhat with typescript
- failed attempt at using `@typechain/hardhat` for contract typing. reverted to using any for now
- successfully compile and deployed to local hardhat network
- using waffle on sample-test.ts. waffle allows me to equals bignumber easily
- seems like npx hardhat node doesnt return me with private keys in typescript
- learnt how to use task and `npx hardhat` will list out available list of tasks
